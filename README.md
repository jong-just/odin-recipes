# odin-recipes

This is the first real website created by me. All skills have been taught through
the Odin Project. This website will demonstrate skills learned on the HTML language
and show my current understanding on it's functions. This will not look great
as I have not learned CSS yet, but will revisit in a future date to go over and add
style through CSS. This will be using:

- Git
- HTML

Update 1: Also was able to learn very basic CSS. Added very bad looking color, but 
it does have color now. Also fixed super large pictures which looks nice.
